# Migration Summary

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring performed on the application to enhance its architecture, focusing on a feature-based organization and improved data handling strategies.

## Key Changes

### 1. Feature-Based Organization

- Reorganized codebase into feature modules (auth, dashboard)
- Each feature contains its own components, hooks, services, and types
- Created clear public APIs through feature index.ts files

### 2. Enhanced TanStack Query Integration

- Created centralized query service layer in `services/api/queryService.ts`
- Implemented specialized hooks for different data operations:
  - `useApiQuery` - For GET operations with automatic caching
  - `useApiMutation` - For POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE operations
  - `useApiQueryWithParams` - For parameterized GET requests
  - `useDirectApiCall` - For bypassing cache when necessary

### 3. API Client Architecture

- Enhanced error handling through ErrorHandler class
- Standardized response processing with ResponseHandler
- Created consistent type definitions for API interactions
- Centralized configuration in apiClient.ts

### 4. Type Safety

- Improved TypeScript typing throughout the application
- Added generic types to API functions and hooks
- Created specific interfaces for hook options and responses

### 5. Authentication Flow

- Enhanced auth service with proper hooks and non-hook functions
- Improved cookie handling for secure authentication
- Fixed redirects and callback URLs in login/logout flows

### 6. Component Organization

- Implemented UserProfile component using the new data fetching architecture
- Enhanced Dashboard page with loading states and error handling
- Improved reusability and separation of concerns

### 7. Architecture Correction

- Established a clear separation between service and hook layers
- Moved React hooks from service layer to dedicated hook files
- Ensured services only contain pure business logic functions
- Created specialized hook files for login and logout functionality
- Updated components to use the new dedicated hooks

## Benefits

1. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Clearer code organization makes it easier to locate and modify features
   - Enhanced type safety reduces runtime errors
   - Consistent patterns make the codebase more maintainable

2. **Improved Performance**
   - Smart caching reduces unnecessary network requests
   - Background data refetching keeps data fresh
   - Optimistic updates provide instant feedback for users

3. **Scalability**
   - Feature isolation makes it easier to add new functionality
   - Clear boundaries reduce interdependencies
   - Consistent architecture simplifies onboarding new developers

4. **Better Testability**
   - Pure business logic in services is easier to test
   - Hooks can be tested separately from business logic
   - More maintainable and predictable codebase

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Feature Coverage**
   - Apply the architecture to remaining features and modules
   - Ensure all components follow the new patterns

2. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for core services and hooks
   - Add integration tests for feature flows
   - Set up E2E tests for critical user journeys

3. **Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation with JSDoc
   - Create architectural diagrams
   - Document common patterns and best practices

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting for features
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Add advanced caching strategies
